# Frontend Implementation Report for Backend Team

## Overview
We have completed all frontend tickets (FE-001 through FE-013) and have implemented a fully functional client-side application. This report details our implementation choices and requirements for the backend team.

## Database Integration
We're using Turso (SQLite) for development with the following key tables:
- projects
- characters
- scenes
- scene_history
- scene_memory
- shared_characters

All tables include proper foreign key constraints and indexes for performance.

## API Requirements

### Project Management (BE-001, BE-003)
- GET/POST /projects endpoints implemented
- Project metadata includes: title, description, genre, audience, style, story_length
- All downstream entities (scenes, characters) are scoped by project_id

### User Context (BE-002)
- Currently passing project_id via x-project-id header
- All API routes validate project context
- Middleware protection implemented for /api/workspace/* routes

### Character System (BE-004)
- Full CRUD operations for characters
- Shared character import functionality
- Character data includes rich metadata (background, traits, etc.)
- Proper project scoping implemented

### Scene Management (BE-005)
- Scene ordering system implemented
- Scene content versioning
- Real-time collaboration ready (using Y.js)
- Memory tracking per scene

### Scene Generation (BE-006)
We've implemented the frontend for scene generation with:
- Word count control (500-5000 words)
- Context inclusion (characters, memory)
- Real-time preview
- Version history tracking

### Memory System (BE-007)
Memory inspector categorizes data into:
- Characters
- World Facts
- Plot Points
- Style Notes

### Tavus Integration (BE-008)
- Avatar selection based on genre
- Script generation endpoint
- Video display component
- Coach personality mapping

### Export System (BE-009)
Structured export includes:
- Project metadata
- Character details
- Recent scenes
- Aggregated memory
- Supports both JSON and formatted preview

## Critical Backend Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - Scene list queries need pagination
   - Memory queries should be optimized for quick retrieval
   - Character queries need efficient filtering

2. **Data Validation**
   - Implement strict schema validation
   - Enforce project-level data isolation
   - Validate all foreign key relationships

3. **Real-time Support**
   - WebSocket support for collaborative editing
   - Y.js document sync
   - Cursor position broadcasting

4. **Error Handling**
   - Consistent error response format
   - Proper HTTP status codes
   - Detailed error messages for development

## Integration Points

1. **CrewAI Integration**
   - Scene generation endpoint needs to handle:
     - Word count targets
     - Genre-specific generation
     - Character consistency
     - Memory context

2. **Memory Management**
   - Automatic memory extraction from scene content
   - Memory categorization
   - Memory timeline tracking

3. **Export System**
   - Structured data aggregation
   - Memory context inclusion
   - Scene history preservation

## Security Considerations

1. **API Protection**
   - All workspace routes require project_id
   - Content-Type validation
   - Request size limits

2. **Data Isolation**
   - Strict project scoping
   - User context validation
   - Cross-project access prevention

## Testing Requirements

1. **API Endpoints**
   - Validate all CRUD operations
   - Test error conditions
   - Verify data consistency

2. **Real-time Features**
   - Test collaborative editing
   - Verify cursor synchronization
   - Check conflict resolution

3. **Generation Features**
   - Test various word counts
   - Verify context inclusion
   - Check memory integration

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Priority Order**
   - Complete BE-001 (Project API)
   - Implement BE-002 (User Session)
   - Deploy BE-003 (Project CRUD)
   - Build BE-006 (Scene Generation)

2. **Integration Timeline**
   - Week 1: Core API endpoints
   - Week 2: Real-time features
   - Week 3: AI integration
   - Week 4: Production deployment

## Additional Notes

- Frontend uses Zod for schema validation
- Error handling is centralized through ErrorGuard
- API client includes automatic project context
- Real-time collaboration ready for integration
- Memory system designed for extensibility
