## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework:** Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Database:** Turso (SQLite-based, edge-ready database)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **Animations:** Framer Motion
- **Text Editing:** TipTap rich text editor
- **Drag and Drop:** DnD Kit
- **Icons:** Lucide React
- **Collaboration:** Y.js + WebSocket for real-time editing
- **Type Safety:** TypeScript
- **Validation:** Zod schema validation

### Backend
- **API Framework:** FastAPI (Python)
- **Agent Orchestration:** CrewAI
- **LLM Inference:** Groq API (OpenRouter fallback)
- **Video Generation:** Tavus API for interactive coaching
- **Database:** SQLite (dev), PostgreSQL (production)
- **Environment Management:** uv (via Homebrew)

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ghost-writers-ai.git
cd ghost-writers-ai
```

2. Install `uv` via Homebrew (MacOS):

```bash
brew install astral-sh/uv/uv
```

3. Sync environment dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

4. Add environment variables to `.env`:

```
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key
TAVUS_API_KEY=your-tavus-api-key
CREWAI_API_KEY=your-crewai-key
TURSO_DATABASE_URL=your-turso-db-url
TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN=your-turso-auth-token
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-nextauth-secret
```

5. Start backend server:

```bash
cd backend
uv pip install fastapi uvicorn
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

6. Run frontend:

```bash
cd front-end/project
npm install
npm run dev
```

7. Access app at `http://localhost:3000`.
