## Overview

**Ghost-Writers.AI** empowers creative individuals to build structured fiction using modular AI tools. We combine character cards, scene design, AI memory, and real-time storytelling to help writers collaborate with AI, not compete with it.

Our demo showcases an intuitive writing platform backed by CrewAI agent teams, Groq's blazing-fast LLM inference, and Tavus-generated author interactions.

## Motivation

Writing a novel is overwhelming for many creatives. They struggle with structure, consistency, and momentum. Ghost-Writers.AI lowers the barrier to storytelling by offering structured tools and an AI collaboration framework that assists â€” not replaces â€” the human voice.

Ghost-Writers.AI uniquely combines agent orchestration, narrative memory, and modular creation tools to truly empower fiction writers.

## Features

- **Character Cards:** Define characters with background, traits, and motivations.
- **Scene Cards:** Build scenes with structured setting, conflict, and goals.
- **AI Memory:** Scene summaries are automatically remembered and influence future scenes.
- **CrewAI Agent Collaboration:** Modular agents like Plot Architect and Dialogue Polisher assist the writer.
- **Groq Fast Inference:** Lightning-speed scene generation for real-time creative flow.
- **Tavus Video:** Demo video showing fictional author-AI collaboration.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js (deployed via Vercel or local demo)
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
- **Agent Orchestration:** CrewAI
- **LLM Inference:** Groq API (OpenRouter fallback)
- **Video Generation:** Tavus
- **Environment Management:** uv (via Homebrew)

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ghost-writers-ai.git
cd ghost-writers-ai
```

2. Install `uv` via Homebrew (MacOS):

```bash
brew install astral-sh/uv/uv
```

3. Sync environment dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

4. Add environment variables to `.env`:

```
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key
TAVUS_API_KEY=your-tavus-api-key
CREWAI_API_KEY=your-crewai-key
```

5. Start backend server:

```bash
uv pip install fastapi uvicorn
uvicorn backend.server:app --reload
```

6. Run frontend (if local):

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

7. Access app at `http://localhost:3000`.

## How It Works

1. User creates character and scene cards.
2. User submits scene setup âž” CrewAI agents generate scene drafts.
3. Groq API processes text generation for speed.
4. Scene summaries are captured by AI Memory Manager.
5. Tavus-generated video showcases fictional author collaboration.

## Challenges

- **Agent Coordination:** Structuring modular CrewAI agents to collaborate meaningfully.
- **Memory Handling:** Managing scene summaries across evolving narrative arcs.
- **Frontend-Backend Sync:** Rapid linking of React frontend to FastAPI endpoints.
- **Tight Deadline:** Focused on "working core" over feature sprawl.

## Future Improvements

- Richer worldbuilding templates (fantasy, sci-fi, etc.).
- Multiplayer collaborative writing rooms.
- Genre-specific AI writing personas.
- Deeper narrative memory across 10,000+ words.
